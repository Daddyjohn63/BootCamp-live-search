<!-- GENERAL SCOPE STATEMENT

write an app that produces dynamic search data in the web page search results.
The app will open up a lightbox on click of search icon with a search bar that allows the user to type and see a list of options by category

1) General Information
2) Cookery Classes
3) Chefs


The website will be built on my local server using flywheel and will be for a ficticous cookery school.
There will be four sources of information on the website
1) Pages
2) Posts
3) Custom Post Type for Events, with a custom field for the data
4) Custom post types for Chefs with a custom field for the type of cooking they specialise in.
5) The two custom posts will have category relationshops e.g. Indian Food, Thai Food, French Food, Bread Making etc..
6) Load fontawesome library

The site will use the WordPress REST API -->

<!-- INITIAL SET UP AFTER WP SITE AND POSTS SET UP

Set up dev environment with NPM and Yarn/Gulp to create a bundled.js file
Create and enqueue JS file with jquery dependency -->

<!-- JS PRINCIPLES USED
will use class and constructor functions
will use object programming techniques -->

<script>
  // CREATE OVERLAY
  // create div and classes in footer.php (for initial testing). Later I will append to the body.
  // div for the overall search display or active
  // div for the close button
  // div for the input field with id for hooking later in JS

  //CREAT THE OBJECT
  // creeate methods for opening and closing the overlay
  // create events using selector to get the search icon
  // set up the properties in constuctor() for getting the open, close and the overlay
  // create event listeners for when button open is clicked
  // set up event listeners when close button is clicked
  // ensure that the constuctor calls the event listeners when the page is loaded
  // write methods for adding and removing classes when listeners are triggered

  // USER EXPERIENCE / THE VIEW
  // function so that JS does not send request to server on every key stroke
  // consider using keyboard events for opening and closing the overlay ??!
  // provide loader clue / e.g. spinner animation when user is adding search query
  // create HTML elements to append to the 'body'
  // ensure search field is auto 'on-focus' when overlay is opened.
  // error handling required

  // JSON / API
  // use /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?search=xxxxxxx    query
  // create requests for pages and custom posts used
  // try and create my own custom rest url so that minimum data is called.
  // use localize script (name of js file, variable name, array of data we want to make available) to make rest url relative
  // in register_post_type add to array,  'show_in_rest' => true,

  // PLAN
  // Set up the development environment  // revisit week 4
  // Create website with Pages, Posts and Custom Posts
  // Plan the component structure  // revisit Vanilla Press V2 Project from Week 8 //I am only anticipating 100-150 lines of code (is it worth splitting into components in separate files??)
  // Create the Overlay // revisit Week 2
  // Set up the REST API // revisit Week 8  // look at Create Custom Endpoints
  // Write code for getting JSON data into the search overlay for Pages and Posts
  // Write code for getting JSON data into the search overlay for Custom Posts

  // BONUS FEATURE
  // Try and get search to also list relationships between Pages, Posts and Custom Posts
